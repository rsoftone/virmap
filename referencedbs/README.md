# Reference databases #
 
 gb[abbreviated code] 
 
 (e.g. gbvrl) 
 
 each [abbreviated code] correspond to a particular sequence database, called **Genbank divisions**. 
 
 The GenBank database is divided into 18 divisions:

  1. PRI - primate sequences
  2. ROD - rodent sequences
  3. MAM - other mammalian sequences
  4. VRT - other vertebrate sequences
  5. INV - invertebrate sequences
  6. PLN - plant, fungal, and algal sequences
  7. BCT - bacterial sequences
  8. VRL - viral sequences
  9. PHG - bacteriophage sequences
10. SYN - synthetic sequences
11. UNA - unannotated sequences
12. EST - EST sequences (expressed sequence tags)
13. PAT - patent sequences
14. STS - STS sequences (sequence tagged sites)
15. GSS - GSS sequences (genome survey sequences)
16. HTG - HTG sequences (high-throughput genomic sequences)
17. HTC - unfinished high-throughput cDNA sequencing
18. ENV - environmental sampling sequences

Some of the divisions contain sequences from specific groups of organisms, whereas others (EST, GSS, HTG, etc.) contain data generated by specific sequencing technologies from many different organisms.

The descriptions for each of these Genbank divisions can be found in the following two URLs:
